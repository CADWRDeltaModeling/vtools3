# This file is intended to solve two lookup issues. 
#     1. given our data name (var_name) and the name of 
# a data mart/service (cdec, usgs for nwis), look up the code(s) that can possibly represent that variable.
# It isn't always unique ... what we call "flow" gets split up in many variants in cdec, for instance).
#     2. Given a variable name pulled out of a data file delivered by a data mart/service (src_var_name),
# which of our variables does it map to? 
#
# Variables: 
# src_var_name: this is a name for a variable as it appears in *their* files
# src_name: name of the data service (cdec,noaa,usgs). These are automated or manual providers, not collectors
# src_var_id: the code used by the service to fetch new data
# var_name: the dwr/vtools code
# comment: additional notes
