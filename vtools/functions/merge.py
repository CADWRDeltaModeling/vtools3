def ts_merge(series, names=None):
    """
    Merge multiple time series together, prioritizing series in order.

    This function merges a tuple of time series, filling missing values based on
    a priority order. The first series is used as the base, with subsequent series
    filling in missing values where available. If time series have irregular timestamps,
    consider using `ts_splice` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : tuple or list of pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series
        A tuple of time series ranked from highest to lowest priority. Each series
        must have a `DatetimeIndex` and compatible column names.

    names : None, str, or iterable of str, optional
        - If `None` (default), all input series must share common column names,
          and the output will merge common columns or series names.
        - If a `str`, all input series must have a **single column** (or a matching
          column name if mixed types are provided), and the output will be a DataFrame 
          with this name as the column name.
        - If an iterable of `str`, all input DataFrames must have the same 
          number of columns matching the length of the names argument and these will be used 
          for the output.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        - If the input contains DataFrames with multiple columns, the output is a
          DataFrame with the same time extent as the union of inputs and columns.
        - If a collection of single-column `Series` is specified, the output will be 
          converted into a single-column DataFrame.

    Notes
    -----
    - The output time index is the union of input time indices.
    - If a duplicate index exists in the first series, only the first occurrence is used.
    - Lower-priority series only fill gaps in higher-priority series and do not override
      existing values.

def ts_splice(series, names=None, transition="prefer_last", floor_dates=False):
    """
    Splice multiple time series together, prioritizing series in patches of time.

    Unlike `ts_merge`, which blends overlapping data points, `ts_splice` stitches 
    together time series without overlap. The function determines when to switch 
    between series based on a transition strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : tuple or list of pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series
        A tuple or list of time series.
        Each series must have a `DatetimeIndex` and consistent column structure.

    names : None, str, or iterable of str, optional
        - If `None` (default), all input series must share common column names,
          and the output will merge common columns.
        - If a `str`, all input series must have a **single column**, and the 
          output will be a DataFrame with this name as the column name.
        - If an iterable of `str`, all input DataFrames must have the same 
          number of columns matching the length of `names`, and these will be 
          used for the output.

    transition : {'prefer_first', 'prefer_last'} or list of pandas.Timestamp
        Defines how to determine breakpoints between time series:
        - `'prefer_first'`: Uses the earlier series on the list durng until its valid timestamp.
        - `'prefer_last'`: Uses the later series starting from its first valid timestamp.
        - A list of specific timestamps can also be provided as transition points.

    floor_dates : bool, optional, default=False
        If `True`, inferred transition timestamps (`prefer_first` or `prefer_last`) 
        are floored to the beginning of the day. This can introduce NaNs if the 
        input series are regular with a `freq` attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series
        - If the input contains multi-column DataFrames, the output is a DataFrame 
          with the same column structure.
        - If a collection of single-column `Series` is provided, the output will 
          be a Series.
        - The output retains a `freq` attribute if all inputs share the same frequency.

    Notes
    -----
    - The output time index is the union of input time indices.
    - If `transition` is `'prefer_first'`, gaps may appear in the final time series.
    - If `transition` is `'prefer_last'`, overlapping data is resolved in favor 
      of later series.
