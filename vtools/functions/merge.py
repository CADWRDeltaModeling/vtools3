    Merge multiple time series together, prioritizing series in order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : sequence of pandas.Series or pandas.DataFrame
        Higher priority first. All indexes must be DatetimeIndex.
    names : None, str, or iterable of str, optional
        - If `None` (default), inputs must share compatible column names.
        - If `str`, the output is univariate and will be named accordingly.
        - If iterable, it is used as a subset/ordering of columns.
    strict_priority : bool, default False
        If False (default): lower-priority data may fill NaNs in higher-priority
        series anywhere (traditional merge/overlay).
        If True: for each column, within the window
        [first_valid_index, last_valid_index] of any higher-priority series,
        lower-priority data are masked out — even if the higher-priority value is NaN.

def ts_splice(series, names=None, transition="prefer_last", floor_dates=False):
    """
    Splice multiple time series together, prioritizing series in patches of time.

    Unlike `ts_merge`, which blends overlapping data points, `ts_splice` stitches
    together time series without overlap. The function determines when to switch
    between series based on a transition strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : tuple or list of pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series
        A tuple or list of time series.
        Each series must have a `DatetimeIndex` and consistent column structure.

    names : None, str, or iterable of str, optional
        - If `None` (default), all input series must share common column names,
          and the output will merge common columns.
        - If a `str`, all input series must have a **single column**, and the
          output will be a DataFrame with this name as the column name.
        - If an iterable of `str`, all input DataFrames must have the same
          number of columns matching the length of `names`, and these will be
          used for the output.

    transition : {'prefer_first', 'prefer_last'} or list of pandas.Timestamp
        Defines how to determine breakpoints between time series:
        - `'prefer_first'`: Uses the earlier series on the list during until its valid timestamp.
        - `'prefer_last'`: Uses the later series starting from its first valid timestamp.
        - A list of specific timestamps can also be provided as transition points.

    floor_dates : bool, optional, default=False
        If `True`, inferred transition timestamps (`prefer_first` or `prefer_last`)
        are floored to the beginning of the day. This can introduce NaNs if the
        input series are regular with a `freq` attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series
        - If the input contains multi-column DataFrames, the output is a DataFrame
          with the same column structure.
        - If a collection of single-column `Series` is provided, the output will be
          a Series.
        - The output retains a `freq` attribute if all inputs share the same frequency.

    Notes
    -----
    - The output time index is the union of input time indices.
    - If `transition` is `'prefer_first'`, gaps may appear in the final time series.
    - If `transition` is `'prefer_last'`, overlapping data is resolved in favor
      of later series.
